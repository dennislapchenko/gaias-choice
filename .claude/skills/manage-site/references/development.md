# Development — Gaia's Choice

Stack: Vite 6 + React 18 + TS (strict), `react-router-dom` BrowserRouter,
single hand-written `src/styles.css`, content bundled at build time via
`import.meta.glob` in `src/lib/content.ts`. No backend, no CMS, no runtime
fetching. Architecture details live in the repo `CLAUDE.md` — read it before
structural changes.

## Commands (always via Taskfile — never host npm)

| Command | What |
| --- | --- |
| `task typecheck` | strict `tsc --noEmit` — **`task build` does NOT type-check** |
| `task build` | build SPA to `dist/` |
| `task dev` | Vite dev server :5173 — **needs a TTY** (docker `-it`); fails under preview harnesses/CI |
| `task images` | optimize `public/images` → WebP |
| `task audit` | `npm audit` — must stay at 0 vulns |
| `task lock` | regenerate lockfile (no scripts) |
| `task verify` | audit + typecheck + image build |
| `task run` | production image on :8080 |
| `task deploy` | `gcloud run deploy --source .` (override `REGION=`/`SERVICE=`) |

Docker daemon down (`Cannot connect to the Docker daemon`)? This machine uses
OrbStack: `open -a OrbStack`, wait ~15s, retry.

## Verification recipe

1. `task typecheck && task build`
2. Visual/behavioral check — serve the fresh `dist/` statically instead of
   `task dev` (the TTY problem above):

   ```json
   // .claude/launch.json at the workspace root (NOT inside gaias-choice/)
   { "version": "0.0.1", "configurations": [{
       "name": "dist",
       "runtimeExecutable": "python3",
       "runtimeArgs": ["-m", "http.server", "5180", "-d", "gaias-choice/dist"],
       "port": 5180 }] }
   ```

3. **Deep links 404 on a static server** (SPA fallback lives in nginx, not
   `http.server`) — load `/` and navigate by clicking, or drive
   `location.href` via eval. `task run` gives the real nginx behavior when
   fallback itself needs testing.

## Common dev tasks

- **New palette:** append to `content/themes.yaml` (tag, label, 10 color keys —
  see `ThemeColors` in `src/lib/types.ts`). No code change. Exactly one entry
  keeps `default: true`; if you change which, sync the `:root` fallback values
  in `styles.css` (first-paint frame). Check `onAccent` contrast per palette.
- **New route/page:** route in `src/App.tsx`; nav from `site.yaml` `nav:` /
  `footerNav:` (never hardcode links in `Layout.tsx`).
- **New sidebar widget:** add a `<section className="side-card">` in
  `src/components/Sidebar.tsx`. The almanac (`AstroCalendar` + `lib/astro.ts`)
  is real ephemeris math — extend its event generators, never swap in a
  horoscope API.
- **New content field:** extend the type in `src/lib/types.ts`, render it in
  the component — `content.ts` spreads frontmatter automatically, no parser
  changes needed.
- **New dependency:** a real decision, not a default. Zero-install-script,
  browser-safe, minimal transitive deps (that's why `yaml` not `gray-matter`).
  Then `task lock && task audit`. Surface it to the owner.

## Known gotchas

- `vite build` ships type errors silently — always run `task typecheck` too.
- nginx serves `index.html` (200) for missing images — only `/assets/` hard-404s.
- `BASE_PATH` env drives the base for the GitHub Pages workflow; local/Cloud
  Run use `/`. Use `withBase`/`withBaseHtml` (`src/lib/asset.ts`) for asset
  URLs in code.
- A host `node_modules/` is an empty mount stub — safe to delete, don't
  populate it.
- Git repo state is deliberately staged-but-uncommitted at times; never
  commit/push unless the owner asks.

## The dev roadmap (in priority order — from `/roadmap`)

1. **Build-time prerendering** of every route to static HTML — the keystone:
   unlocks real SEO, Open Graph, Pinterest Rich Pins. All routes are knowable
   at build time (content glob + static pages), so a Vite prerender pass fits.
2. Per-page `<title>` + meta description (cheap interim: `document.title` on
   route change).
3. `sitemap.xml` generated from `content/` at build time (`public/robots.txt`
   already has a commented Sitemap line awaiting the domain).
4. Privacy-friendly cookieless analytics (update `/privacy` first).
5. `/go/<slug>` affiliate redirect service with click counting — check each
   program's cloaking policy (Amazon forbids it; raw links there).

When you complete one of these, tick it on `content/pages/roadmap.md`.
